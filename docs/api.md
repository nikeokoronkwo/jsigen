# `jsigen` public API
The JSIGen package contains a public API for being able to interact with the functions used, as well as to make use of `jsigen` in your own projects, as well as in Dart.

The API is (to be) used extensively in the Dart implementation of [dyte]() for interfacing with JS code and Dart code when creating dev servers for the frontend.

## API
The package is used as an npm package.
```js
import * as jsigen from "jsigen";


```
